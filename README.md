<h2>Andromeda Edge</h2>
Andromeda Edge it is a seperate module which enables Secure Folder support on rooted Galaxy devices. But when it is installed, the installation of other modules it is a little painful. It is made seperate because the module has to be entirely disabled and we do not want to lose any data while other modules' installation process. More info is below Notes section.

<h2>Installation</h2>

1. Setup KernelSU if you have not done yet.
2. Download the latest version of Andromeda from [releases](https://github.com/hakhanihsan/Andromeda/releases) page.
3. If you want, you can download Andromeda Edge too.
4. Install in KernelSU.
5. Reboot the system.

<h2>Updating</h2>

1. If installed, disable Andromeda Edge module in KernelSU.
2. Reboot the system.
3. Update the module in KernelSU.
4. If you want, update Andromeda Edge and enable it.
5. Reboot the system again and you are done.

<h2>Compability</h2>
Samsung Galaxy A54 5G with A546EXXS8CXE2 (Android 14/One UI 6.1) firmware is fully supported (SM-A546B is untested as I do not have that model).

<h2>Notes</h2>

1. You cannot install any module that modifies the system while Andromeda Edge is enabled. Before installing, disable it and reboot. After that, you can install your new module and enable Andromeda Edge.
2. Andromeda Edge only supports Samsung Galaxy A54 5G. Other devices are not supported.
3. Andromeda could work on other devices, but it is not guaranteed.
4. The module itself currently supports only Turkey (TUR) CSC, but it is expected to be universal in future releases. For now, you can manually edit country specific things inside the zip.
5. Magisk support is not tested.
