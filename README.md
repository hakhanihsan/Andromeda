Samsung Galaxy A54 5G with A546EXXSBCXL3 (Android 14 / One UI 6.1) firmware is fully supported.

<h2>Notes</h2>

1. Andromeda is intended to work on SM-A546E model with KernelSU. It is not guaranteed to work with other devices & root solutions.
2. The module itself currently supports only Turkey (TUR) CSC, but it is expected to be universal in future releases. For now, you can manually edit country specific things inside the zip.
3. This module includes Samsung's own proprietary software. Their terms apply. I am not responsible for any misuse of their software, data leaks etc.
